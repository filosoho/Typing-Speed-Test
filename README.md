# Typing-Speed-Test
Typing Speed Test Application. This Python script creates a simple GUI desktop application using Tkinter to test your typing speed. It presents a random text phrase for you to type, measures your typing speed in words per minute (WPM), and provides instant feedback. 


## How It Works

The application's main features include:

- Generating random text phrases for typing practice.
- Measuring your typing speed (WPM) accurately.
- A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter.
- Easy-to-use buttons to start the test and check your typing speed.

## Usage

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python script:
~~~
TypingSpeedTest.py
~~~

2. Click the "Start Test" button to initiate the typing test.

3. A random text phrase will appear in the top label. Type this phrase into the input field as quickly and accurately as possible.

4. After completing the typing test, click the "Check Speed" button to calculate your typing speed in words per minute (WPM). The result will be displayed below.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python installations).
